<!-- Step one. Include the base. -->
<%inherit file="base.mako"/>

<!-- Step two. Modify the title so that it's specific to the user. -->
<%block name="title">
	${user.username}
</%block>

<!-- Step three. Make the body. -->
<h1>${user.username}</h1>
<img 
	src="${request.static_url('sins:static/avatars/%(name)s' % topic.user.avatar)}" 
	alt=${user.username} 
/>

<!-- Step four. List any current bans that are applied to the user -->
<!-- I will need to decide how to display this information on the page. Until
			then I will just leave it as raw data. I think more than likely it will
			probably end up being displayed in a table
-->
<!-- I forgot to bootstrap this. I will have to bootstrap this. -->
<!-- Use a list group for this. -->
<div class="list-group">
	% for ban in user.bans:
			<a 
				href="${request.route_url('ban', ban_id=ban.ban_id)}" 
				class="list-group-item"
			>
				<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">
					${ban.start_date}
					% if end_date:
							${ban.end_date}
					% endif
				</h4>
				
				<p class="list-group-item-text">
					${ban.reason}
				</p>
			</a>
	% endfor
</div>

<!-- Step five. List all of the groups that the user is a member of. -->
<!-- This might take some thinking since a membership is a relational entity.
			However, memberships are backref'd to groups, so it's possible that I will
			be able to get that information directly
-->

<!-- Step six. Give the user the opportunity to edit their post. This should be
			displayed only if the user viewing the page is also the user whose page it
			belongs to. For right now this is displaying for all users.
-->
<a href=
	"${request.route_url('user_action', action='edit', _query={'user_id':user.user_id})}"
>
	Edit profile
</a>

<!-- Step seven. List the most recent posts by the user. -->
<!-- This will take a little more logic than what is here right now.  -->
<!-- This, much like memberships might be a little more complicated than it
			appears. More than likely it will be fine because of the backref. But I'm
			going to put this off for just right now.
-->
<!-- Posts should link to the topic where they were posted. -->
<!-- This looks like a great place for a list group -->
<!-- I would like to change this so that posts aren't linked directly. Instead I
			would like to link to the topics where the posts were made. I think a way
			to do this would be to use the fact that forums and topics should be
			backreffed to eachother.

<div class="list-group">
	% for post in posts:
			<a 
				href="${request.rout_url('post', post_id=post.post_id, slug=post.slug)}"
				class="list-group-item"
			>
				<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">${post.date}</h4>
